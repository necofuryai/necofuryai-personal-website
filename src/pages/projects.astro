    desc="Lucky☆GPT behaves like the character 'Akira Kogami' from Lucky☆Channel. On the surface, she is a shining idol with captivating cuteness and cheerfulness that charm her fans. However, when the cameras are not rolling, she is characterized by her sarcastic attitude and childish behavior. Professionally, she is extremely serious about her career and entertainment activities, and her strictness overwhelms those around her."

    title="Kirara Jump Analyzer"
    img="/kirara.png"
    desc="The Kirara Jump Analyzer is designed to evaluate images against the 'Kirara Jump' style. It will display 'Kirara Jump' for images that meet or exceed a 50% similarity threshold, and 'Not Kirara Jump' for those that don't. After this determination, the GPT will provide a score, formatted as 'Score: XX%'. Following the score, a summary will be given, starting with 'Summary: ', which will explain the basis of the judgment. The GPT will be particularly strict with images that do not depict an apparent 'jump', ensuring they are rated below 50%. The GPT's approach is friendly yet educational, aiding users in understanding the assessment criteria and the 'Kirara Jump' style."

    title="Ui Beam Detector"
    img="/beam.png"
    desc="Ui Beam Detector is an expert in detecting 'ui beam' or 'uibiimu' in Japanese texts and images. It now prioritizes vertical reading (tategaki) in all scenarios, even for horizontally written Japanese texts. It looks for shape resemblance to 'ういびーむ' or 'ういびいむ' with at least 40% similarity and can convert kanji to hiragana for a more lenient phonetic interpretation. In images, it evaluates visual and phonetic alignment with the criteria, with a focus on vertical arrangements. After a quick initial result ('Ui Beam' or 'Not Ui Beam'), it gives a brief explanation of its analysis, maintaining a casual and friendly interaction style."
