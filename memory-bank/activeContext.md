# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initializing the memory bank with core documentation files.
- Establishing a clear foundation for the project's context and progress tracking.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to outline the project's objectives and success criteria.
- Created `productContext.md` to define the purpose, problems addressed, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Create the remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Begin documenting system architecture and technical details.

## Active Considerations
- Ensure all documentation is clear and concise for future reference.
- Maintain consistency across all memory bank files.
